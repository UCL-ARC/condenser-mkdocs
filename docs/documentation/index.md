# Getting Started

The Condenser platform provides pools of compute and storage resources that can be
used to create virtual machines, networks, and volumes.

## Deploying virtual resources

Within the UCL network, Condenser can be accessed through [Rancher](https://rancher.condenser.arc.ucl.ac.uk).
Resources can be deployed manually through this interface. Resources can also be
automatically deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) methods such as [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language).

We have documentation demonstrating a simple [Terraform deployment](./deploying_resources/deploying_terraform.md/#configure-the-vm-for-ssh-access)
and the equivalent manual deployment in the [Rancher GUI](./deploying_resources/deploying_rancher.md).

Some advantages of describing deployments with IaC are that deployments become repeatable
and are easier to audit and contribute to. We collect [examples](./examples.md) of
deployments for Condenser.

Both the GUI and Terraform deployments use Harvester to deploy resources on the underlying
kubernetes cluster, which uses [kubevirt](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/) to provide
virtual machines. In case a deployment requires features that are not yet enabled
by Harvester, resources can also be deployed directly onto a kubernetes cluster with
[`kubectl`](./deploying_resources/deploying_kubernetes.md).

## Administration of virtual resources

On Condenser, developers are responsible for administering their own virtual resources.
Please refer to the appropriate documentation. Some starting points are listed below.

# About the Platform

Condenser is a private cloud platform for research computing at UCL. It provides
a cost-effective, private alternative to public cloud platforms. The platform is
developed and maintained by the [Advanced Research Computing Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/).
All hardware resides in UCL facilities.

## Tenancy

Tenants are provided with access to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)
cluster. Members of a tenancy can deploy virtual machines and related cloud-computing
resources with [Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io). [Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/)
is used to provide access to the cluster and to apply resource quotas per-tenancy.

# About the Platform

Condenser is a private cloud platform for research computing at UCL. It provides
a cost-effective, private alternative to public cloud platforms. The platform is
developed and maintained by the [Advanced Research Computing Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/).
All hardware resides in UCL facilities.

## Tenancy

Access to Condenser is organized in tenant groups. Tenants are responsible for
managing their users and virtual resources. Members of a tenancy are provided with
access to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)
cluster. Members can deploy virtual machines and related cloud-computing resources
with [Harvester](https://docs.harvesterhci.io). [Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/)
is used to provide access to the cluster. Resource quotas are applied to the tenancy.

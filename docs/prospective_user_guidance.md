# Prospective user guidance

Condenser is a private cloud alternative to public cloud offerings. In many cases,
Condenser can provide a superior experience for UCL research and at a lower cost.
We have written this guidance to help prospective users decide whether their project
can run on the Condenser platform. This guidance is not a binding contract.

To discuss your potential tenancy and obtain a quote, please create a request in
[MyServices](https://myservices.ucl.ac.uk/login) under the "Condenser" service.

## Our responsibilities

Condenser is supported by the ARC Environments and Infrastructure teams. We maintain
the hardware and virtual infrastructure for the clusters in Condenser. We are
responsible for:

- Updating the platform software
- Implementing platform-level security measures, such as role-based access control,
  tenant isolation, and SSH certificate registration
- Implementing and amending tenancy quotas
- Maintaining the clusters to a standard such that users can deploy virtual machines,
  data volumes, networks, and other resources within their tenancy quota
- Maintaining access from the platform to the internet
- Making up-to-date OS images available on the platform
- Maintaining platform features such as SSH access and web ingress for virtual machines
- Creating and updating documentation for the Condenser platform
- Onboarding new users
- Supporting users in their access to and normal use of the platform through UCL

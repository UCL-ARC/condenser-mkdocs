# Condenser User Documentation

Condenser is a private cloud platform for UCL. Condenser is developed and maintained
by the Environments team of the [Advanced Research Computing Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/).

End users seeking documentation for products that run on Condenser need to refer
to the developer of the application. This documentation does not cover products
that run on the Condenser platform. However, we do maintain a [page on accessing
VMs that run on Condenser by SSH](./end_user_guide/ssh.md).

Developers can refer to our [Getting started page](./developer_guide/index.md) for
general advice on deploying virtual resources on Condenser.

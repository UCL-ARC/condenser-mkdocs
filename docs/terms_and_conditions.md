# Terms and Conditions of Use

All use of Condenser is subject to the general [UCL Computing Regulations](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/information-security/sites/information_security/files/regulations.pdf).

## Commercial Services

It is not permitted to provide commercial services on our systems.

## Access Suspension

If you:

- are subject to a UCL disciplinary procedure,
- or breach UCL's Computing Regulations,
- or are suspected to have shared your access credentials,
- or are suspected to be involved in a security incident,

we may raise this with relevant UCL teams (such as the Information Security Group,
or Human Resources) and suspend your access to the platform until any relevant processes
have been completed.

## Your Data

Condenser has data storage capabilities, but should not be treated as the sole repository
for your data. We do not make contractual agreements about uptime or availability.

Outages and data-loss events will be handled on a best-efforts basis within normal
UCL working hours.

### Data Access by Support Staff

We will not access your data without your consent, except in the following circumstances:

- You contact us with a support issue and the data is relevant to your request.
- We have reason to believe the data is relevant to investigating an on-going security
  incident.
- In automated processes, such as backups, or transfers between storage systems
  for platform maintenance.

Occasionally support requests require more involved work, including accessing resources
as a user. This can be disruptive or involve changes to your resources. In this
case we will check with you when it is safe to begin the work, and we will notify
you when the work has ended.

## Acknowledgement in Works

We request that you acknowledge the use of Condenser in any publications describing
research that has used the system, in any part. The following words should be used:

> "The authors acknowledge the use of the UCL Condenser Platform, and associated
> support services, in the completion of this work."

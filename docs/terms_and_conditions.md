The following terms also apply to the use of Condenser.

Condenser is a private cloud platform on which you may deploy virtual computing
resources such as data volumes and virtual machines. In this document, we refer to
these as your resources.

The terms of service on Condenser will be described by a forthcoming User Guidance
and Responsibilities document.

## Sensitive information

## Access Suspension

If you

we may raise this with relevant UCL teams, such as the Information Security Group,
or Human Resources. We may suspend your access to the platform until any relevant
processes have been completed.

## Your Resources and Data

Your resources on Condenser should not be treated as the sole repository for
your data. We do not make contractual agreements about uptime or availability.

Outages and data-loss events will be handled on a best-efforts basis within normal
UCL working hours.
